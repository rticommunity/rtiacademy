# Connext DDS

In this directory you will find the code for the "Writing a Connext DDS Chat Application" course 
in the [RTI Academy](rtiacademy.com/learn)

This example builds a command-line chat application using Connext DDS. It defines the types, the 
topics and the Quality of Service best suited for a scalable distributed application.

There are several tags, corresponding to each coding video:
chat-app_video8 to chat-app_video17

Additionally, there is a separate branch that allows building the last version of the code with 
CMake: [chat-app_cmake](https://github.com/rticommunity/rtiacademy/tree/chat-app_cmake)
